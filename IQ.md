# OSI model  
* The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.  
* OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.

# ELB  
* 1. application load balencer (layer 7 -application layer)  
  2. network load balancer  (layer 4 - transport layer)   
  3. gateway loadbalancer  
## appliation load balancer:  
target group: Target groups route requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify.
